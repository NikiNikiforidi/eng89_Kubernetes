### Why use Kubernetes





- ---------------------------
### When not to use K8
- Kubernetes can be an overkill for simple applications
	- Kubernetes is a complex but powerful technology that allows you to run software in a cloud environment at a massive scale pretty efficiently. However, if you do not intend to develop anything complex for a large or distributed audience (so, you are not building a worldwide online shop with thousands of customers for example) or with high computing resource needs (e.g. machine learning applications), there is not much benefit for you from the technical power of k8s.
- Kubernetes is very complex and can reduce productivity


- Kubernetes can be more expensive than its alternatives

- Acumatica
- Sage Intecct
- And more
