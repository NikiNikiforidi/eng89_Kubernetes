### What is k8
- Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
<br> </br>
- ----------------------
### Benefits of using k8

- Portability and flexibility
	- Kubernetes works with virtually any type of container runtime. 
- Multi-cloud capability
	- Kubernetes can host workloads running on a single cloud as well as workloads that are spread across multiple clouds
- Increased developer productivity
	- Teams can scale and deploy faster than they ever could in the past
- Open source
	- Kubernetes is a fully open source, community-led project overseen by the CNCF
- Proven and battle-tested
- Market leader
<br> </br>

- ---------------------------
### When not to use K8
- Kubernetes can be an overkill for simple applications
	- Kubernetes is a complex but powerful technology that allows you to run software in a cloud environment at a massive scale pretty efficiently. However, if you do not intend to develop anything complex for a large or distributed audience (so, you are not building a worldwide online shop with thousands of customers for example) or with high computing resource needs (e.g. machine learning applications), there is not much benefit for you from the technical power of k8s.
- Kubernetes is very complex and can reduce productivity


- Kubernetes can be more expensive than its alternatives
<br> </br>
- ------------------------
### Competitors of K8
- NetSuite
- SAP ERP
- G2 Deals
- Acumatica
- Sage Intecct
- And more
<br> </br>
- -------------------------
### What is the difference between K8 managed service and unmanaged K8 services 


- Managed Kubernetes
	- Managed Kubernetes is when third-party providers take over responsibility for some or all of the work necessary for the successful set-up and operation of K8s
	- Each cloud platform provides Kubernetes management services
	- Provider-managed Kubernetes service reduces the overhead for managing and maintaining a cluster, it manages the master node for you.


- Unmanaged Kubernetes
	- You have to deal with the installation and maintenance of Kubernetes yourself
	- With self-managed Kubernetes, you have more flexibility over your cluster. You can use cloud provider services like EC2, Compute Engine, etc., or even your on-premises machine.

- ------------------------------------
### What is Kubernetes cluster
- A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications. Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services. They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines. In this way, Kubernetes clusters allow for applications to be more easily developed, moved and managed. 
- Kubernetes clusters allow containers to run across multiple machines and environments: virtual, physical, cloud-based, and on-premises. Kubernetes containers are not restricted to a specific operating system, unlike virtual machines. Instead, they are able to share operating systems and run anywhere.
